An effective nighttime vehicle detection approach combines a novel region-ofinterest extraction approach based on vehicle light detection
and object proposals with nighttime image enhancement.
sliding-window paradigm,1,2 that is, scanning
the image with multiscale rectangular
windows and applying a classifier to
the window-defined subimage, which is effective
but time-consuming. Object proposals,
a new technique that computes the
likeliness of each image window being an
object and generates candidate regions containing
objects, has been well studied since
2010.3â€“5 But such methods are developed
on datasets that only contain daytime images,
so windows containing nighttime vehicles
might have low scores due to the low
contrast and luminosity that make vehicle
features unclear. Figure 1a shows an example
of two low-scoring nighttime vehicles
using EdgeBoxes, which is a state-of-the-art
object proposal approach4; here, only one
vehicle is selected by the top-scoring windows
(in green) and others are missed.
Nighttime image enhancement is indispensable
for nighttime vehicle detection.
H. Lin and Z. Shi6 proposed a multiscale
retinex (MSR)-based method7 for nighttime
image enhancement that is improved on
here. Specifically, this article presents an effective
nighttime vehicle detection approach
that combines region-of-interest (ROI) extraction
and nighttime image enhancement.
During the training stage, five complementary
features are extracted from enhanced
training samples to train five classifiers
via a support vector machine (SVM)8 and
fivefold cross-validation.
